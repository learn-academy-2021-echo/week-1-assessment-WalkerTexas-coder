# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer: Git is a software that tracks changes through any set of files. Git is a version control system that can interact with other software. Git has a set of commands that are used on command line to push and pull from the cloud (ie. Github). Git is used for Version Control and documentation. Github is an online platform and GUI (Graphical User Interface). 



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Anything that evaluates an expression (e.g. a > b). Logical operators, Equality operators, and Relational operators. A Boolean value will return a Boolean value.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: The index is a position of a value within an array. In a loaf of bread the butt of the bread is index 0. A value of an Array can be any data type but index is a locater, and it's data type is number. Indices and values can also be applied to Strings as well as Arrays.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Repeating a command or set of commands a number of times until a desired answer is returned. Iteration allows you to execute functions many times while inputing different data each time. When learning to bake bread I would iterate over different parameters until I got the desired output.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Proper Pair Programming is when two people work together. One is driving and one is navigating. It minimizes mental fatigue and errors. Both people are working on the same code base. People who are working together to solve a problem. Navigator is in charge of the overall process and direction. The Navigator is also responsible for syntax and errors. The Driver is responsible for input, diction and overall typing the code and collaboration. The two people switch roles frequently. Generally every 20 minutes to an hour. 



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Pair Programming; Watching previous cohorts capstone presentation; the robust documentation of the Syllabus; going through the motions of Git; Cool classmates and Instructors. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request: A means of notifying others that changes have been made w/n a repository

2. Higher Order Functions: Are functions that operate on or change other functions. Keeps code to a minimum and reduces bugs. 

3. Jest: A testing framework like Mocha, PHP unit, Rspec. A testing framework checks code for errors. Gives the ability to assert expected outcomes and check those assertions. 

4. Objects: Are data types that contain collections of Keys and Values. They may contain properties and methods. 

5. Classes: The blueprint for Objects. The encapsulate data with the code to work on data. They are reusable. The element used to make objects that summarizes data that works with other data.
